There are three types of user ownership of files
1.) User:
    - A user is the owner of the file.
    - The persom who created the file.
2.) Groups:
      -In this, if a group of individuals is working on a project, then in linux we have the      
      ability to make groups in linux.    
      - A user- group can contains multiple users.
      - All users belonging to a group will have the same access permission to the file.
3.) Others
      - Everybody else
      - Neither created the file, nor he belongs to a user-group who could won the file.

 Permissions of files
 1.) Read
    - Authority to open and read a file.
    - Read on directory gives you the ability to lists its content
 2.) Write
    - Authority to modify the contents od a file.
    - Write on directory gives you the authority to add, remove and renames files
     stored.
 3.) Execute
     - You cannot run a program unless the execute permission is set               
     
     Changing File Permission in linux
     
     --Absolute(Numeric) Mode
         - 0 for no permission
         - 1 for execute
         - 2 for write
         - 4 for read
       Example:
                (Read+Write+Execute (rwx)) 7 (Read+write(rw-)) 6 (Read(r--)) 4
       
       Changing file/directory permission
       -----------------------------------
       chmod 764 test
       chmod = change mod   
       764 = user group other permission
       test = file name
